# Wingsuit Skydives

<img src="https://github.com/SaharAwaji/Analyze-Spatial-Data/blob/main/skydiving%20.jpeg" alt="Skydives" width="200"/>

This project analyzes spatial data from Dr. Smith's wingsuiting. The goal of the project is to help Dr. Smith become a better wingsuit pilot, 
and improve the data set where the fields can be altered. 
The data includes time in the plane, wingsuit flying/freefall, and under the canopy. 
Each of these phases needs to be separated in your analysis.

Some of the jumps in the data are not wingsuit skydives. These jumps need to be removed from the analysis. 
None of the jumps at Skydive Miami are wingsuit flights. Jumps with very little horizontal freefall movement are not wingsuit jumps.
